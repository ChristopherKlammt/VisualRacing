# 1. Analyze Acceleration Behavior
## 1.1 Brief Description
The use case 'Analyze Acceleration Behavior' analyzes whether the driver accelerates the car at it's full potential and gives hints on how to improve it (e.g. Less Throttle, More Throttle, Downshift, ...).
Those calculations are based on the throttle pedal position, RPM and wheel slip.
